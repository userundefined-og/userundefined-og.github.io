Dawn of the Dad is basically the 2 solvers: one for sudoku, and another for building crosswords.

So why build the site and why ramble in this blog?
The site is my excuse to write some code, both to stay sharp and because I like doing it, solve some algorithmically interesting problems, and revisit some of the neat things I&rsquo;ve learned about back in grad school."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.117.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Why tho"><meta property="og:description" content="What and why?

Originally, this spun off as a yet-another-rewrite of a general-purpose <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem>CSP</a> solver, which then led to adding fairly ad hoc visualization, which led to building a web server, hacking up a websocket protocol, glueing it all together and finally hosting it on Google Cloud.</p></li><li><p>The blog is largely meant to capture some of the interesting things I&rsquo;ve learned along the way, like tuning / optimizing the solver and dealing with the hug of death I got from that one time my site briefly hit the front page of <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/news>Hacker News</a>.</p></li></ul><h1 id=post-frequency>Post frequency</h1><p>I&rsquo;ll probably end up writing a bunch of posts as I&rsquo;m catching up on a year&rsquo;s worth of potentially interesting things to write down, before I forget them. Once I do, I expect things to slow down a fair bit, as this is just a hobby of mine.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://blog.dawnofthe.dad/>&copy; Blog of the Dad 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
